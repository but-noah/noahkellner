## The Vision

Create a personal brand website that showcases my work while pushing the boundaries of what a portfolio site can be. The centerpiece: an AI chatbot that can answer questions about me in my own voice.

## Design Philosophy

**Editorial Minimalism** – Clean, sophisticated design inspired by high-end publications. Dark theme with warm accent colors, careful typography, and subtle animations.

### Key Design Decisions
- Dark theme for visual impact and reduced eye strain
- Warm sand/beige accent color for personality
- Newsreader font for content, system fonts for UI
- Grain texture overlay for depth

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack
- **Astro** for content-first static generation
- **React Islands** for interactive components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations

### AI Chatbot (Coming Soon)
- Claude API for conversation
- ElevenLabs for voice cloning
- Deepgram for speech-to-text
- Real-time streaming responses

## Current Status

The foundation is complete with the design system, layouts, and main pages. Currently working on the content collections and project showcase. The AI chatbot will be the final feature.

## Roadmap

1. ✅ Foundation & Design System
2. ✅ Content Collections & Projects
3. 🔄 Blog & CV Pages
4. ⏳ AI Voice Chatbot
5. ⏳ Production Deployment
